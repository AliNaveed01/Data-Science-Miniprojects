        "\n",
        "Question: Why is it important to perform basic statistical calculations in data science?Answer: Basic statistical calculations help us understand the central tendencies, variations, and distributions of data. They provide valuable insights for making data-driven decisions, identifying patterns, and drawing meaningful conclusions from the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question: Which libraries can be used to perform basic statistical calculations in Python?Answer: Libraries such as NumPy and SciPy can be used to perform basic statistical calculations in Python. NumPy provides functions for numerical operations, while SciPy offers a wide range of statistical functions and algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question: What does the mean represent in statistics?Answer: The mean is a measure of central tendency that represents the average value of a dataset. It is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question: How does the standard deviation measure the spread of data?Answer: The standard deviation quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset. It measures how far individual data points deviate from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question: What do skewness and kurtosis measure in statistics?Answer: Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution, indicating whether the data is skewed to the left (negative skew) or to the right (positive skew). Kurtosis measures the shape of the distribution and determines whether the data has heavy tails or is more peaked compared to a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Basic Definitions and Terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistics: The branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It involves techniques for summarizing data, drawing inferences, and making predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mean: Also known as the average, the mean is a measure of central tendency calculated by summing all values in a dataset and dividing by the number of observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median: The median is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value in an ordered dataset. It separates the lower and upper halves of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or spread of data around the mean. It quantifies the average distance between each data point and the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Skewness: Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution. Positive skewness indicates a longer tail on the right side of the distribution, while negative skewness indicates a longer tail on the left side.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple Choice Questions:\n",
        "\n",
