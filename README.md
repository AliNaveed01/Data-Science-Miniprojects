# Data Science Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects related to data science, encompassing various topics such as data wrangling, machine learning models, and data cleaning. The labs are designed for semesters 4, 5, and 6, covering essential concepts in data science. The projects are presented as Jupyter Notebooks and are compatible with both local environments and Google Colab.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following requirements installed on your system:

- **Python:** Version 3.6 or higher. You can check your Python version by running the following command:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

  If you need to update Python, you can download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Jupyter Notebook:** For running the notebooks locally.
  ```bash
  pip install jupyter
  ```

- **Google Colab:** For running the notebooks on Google Colab, you need a Google account.

## Mini-Projects Overview

1. **Data Wrangling Lab (Semester 4):**
   - Introduction to data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding data patterns.
   - Application of data wrangling methods using pandas.

2. **Machine Learning Models (Semester 5):**
   - Implementation of various machine learning models.
   - Supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.
   - Evaluation of model performance using metrics.

3. **Data Cleaning with Stats and Visualizations (Semester 6):**
   - Statistical analysis for identifying outliers and anomalies.
   - Data cleaning strategies based on statistical insights.
   - Data visualization techniques for better understanding.

## Running Notebooks

### Local Environment

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd data-science-mini-projects
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the desired notebook in your browser.

### Google Colab

1. Upload the notebook to your Google Drive or directly open it with Google Colab.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.
